Allows players to open the gamemode switcher and toggle their gamemode even if they do not have the required permission level.

Gamemode Unrestrictor requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

## Installation

1. Download Gamemode Unrestrictor from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gamemode-unrestrictor/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Gamemode-Unrestrictor/releases).
2. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

When this mod is installed, the gamemode switcher and quick toggle will be available even if the player does not appear to have permission to use the `/gamemode` command. This is useful for scenarios where the player has access to the `/gamemode` command but not the permission level required for it, such as due to a [player role](https://github.com/Gegy/player-roles).
